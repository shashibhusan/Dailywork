 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is the exact difference between service discovery and Service Gateway?<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
		 The Services gateway (a.k.a. API gateway) is receiving requests from the clients. It is the (single)
		 service that the clients see. But it doesn't know by itself how to do what the clients want so it must
		 forward the request to another service. It inspects the URL and extracts the name of the service that
		 will actually serve the request, the backend service. That backend service may be located on a
		 different machine. It may have a dynamic address or port, that may change from time to time, from
		 different reasons (nodes fail, new nodes are added to the network etc).<br/>
		 <br/>
		 So, the gateway doesn't know where to forward the request. This is the job of the Service-discovery
		 service (Eureka). Eureka knows on which node is located and at which address and port every
		 service is listening for requests. The gateway is asking Eureka where it can find the backend service
		 (by sending it only its name). After Eureka is responding, the gateway is forwarding the request to that address.<br/>
 
 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is the service model of cloud services<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b>
	 <br/>
	SaaS : software as a Service like Gmail<br/>

	6-terremark<br/>	
	
	<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is cloud<br/>

	<b class="redC">Answer:-</b>If we describe in more general term we can say that there are organization that go ahead bought the server, compute capacity,storage places,compute services
				& all other things and they have their own channel or network.<br/>
				All you have to do is to go ahead rent the resources only to amount you needed & Only for time being you needed.
				and other things is that these providers/organization will take care of all the other things like maintainance & security & other things.
				so that you can focus on your business only forget about all the other things.<br/>

 <b style="color: red">Question:-What is Spring Boot</b><br/>
 Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework.<br/>
 It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">or</b><br/>
 In short, Spring Boot is the combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers.<br/>
 <br/>
 <img src="image/what-is-spring-boot.png" alt="What is Spring Boot"><br/>
 
 <b style="color: red">Advantages of Spring Boot</b><br/>
 <b>1-</b>It tests web applications easily with the help of different Embedded HTTP servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc.<br/>
 We don't need to deploy WAR files.<br/>
 <b>2-</b>There is no requirement for XML configuration.<br/>
 <b>3-</b>It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.<br/>
 <b>4-</b>It offers the number of plug-ins.<br/>
 <b>5-</b>It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes (the code that has to be included in many places with little or no<br/>
 alteration), XML configuration, and annotations.<br/>
 <b>6-</b>It increases productivity and reduces development time.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">What Spring Boot brings to the table</b><br/>
 <b>1-</b>-Convetion over configuration<br/>

 <b style="color: red">Question:-What is starter template</b><br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Spring Boot starters are templates that contain a collection of all the relevant transitive dependencies that are needed to start a particular functionality.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@EnableAutoConfiguration:-</b>This annotation enable Spring Boot to automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@SpringBootApplication:-</b>The entry point of the spring boot application is the class contains @SpringBootApplication annotation and the main method.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Note:-</b>If you added @SpringBootApplication annotation to the class, you do not need to add the
 @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan and @SpringBootConfiguration annotation.The @SpringBootApplication annotation includes all other annotations.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@ComponentScan:-</b>Spring Boot application scans all the beans and package declarations when the application initializes.
 You need to add the @ComponentScan annotation for your class file to scan your components added in your project.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Note:-</b>There is spring intializr page using this page create spring boot application.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Creating Spring Boot application</b><br/>
 Spring Boot had been built for rapid application development<br/>

 1st go to the pom.xml location then Type mvn install. A jar file will be created in that location<br/>
 then type java -jar "name_of the_jar_file" then jar file will be executed which we can check on the browser<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What is Spring Boot CLI<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command line tool that you can use to quickly prototype with Spring.
 It lets you run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a familiar Java-like syntax without so much boilerplate code.
 <b>You do not need to use the CLI to work with Spring Boot, but it is definitely the quickest way to get a Spring application off the ground.</b><br/>
 <b style="color: red">Disadvantages of Spring Boot</b><br/>
 <b style="color: red">1-Migration Efforts</b><br/>
 Migration form already existing spring project to spring boot is not straightforward. Spring Boot is mostly for new development.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">2-Deployment to WebSphere/WebLogic/Other App Servers</b><br/>
 Deploying Spring Boot application to WebSphere/WebLogic and other App servers are not very simple.You need to make few changes
 like downgrading JPA Version,removing conflicting Jars etc in order to make it work in application server.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">3-MicroServices & Cloud Native</b><br/> 
 Spring Boot has been developed Keeping Micro services & Cloud Native in mind. You my not see improvements in other areas.<br/>
 Note:- you can get all the application properties by simply google to "spring boot common application properties"<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>what is spring data jpa.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>Spring Data JPA API provides JpaTemplate class to integrate spring application with JPA. JPA (Java Persistent API) is the sun specification for persisting objects in the enterprise application.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b><br/>
 What is Spring Boot Actuator<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Spring Boot provides actuator to monitor and manage our application. Actuator is a tool which has HTTP endpoints. when
 application is pushed to production, you can choose to manage and monitor your application using HTTP endpoints.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>How to connect Spring Boot to the database using JPA<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>Spring Boot provides spring-boot-starter-data-jpa starter to connect Spring application with relational database efficiently. You can use it into project POM (Project Object Model) file<br/>
 <b style="color: red">What are some important features of using Spring Boot</b><br/>
 <b>1.</b>Starter dependency<br/>
 <b>2.</b>Auto-Configuration<br/>
 <b>3.</b>Spring Initializer<br/>
 <b>4.</b>Spring Actuator<br/>
 <b>5.</b>Spring CLI<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What embedded containers does Spring Boot support?<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>Spring Boot support three embedded containers: Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. By default, it uses Tomcat as embedded containers but you can change it to Jetty or Undertow.<br/>
 
 <b style="color: red">Important Spring Annotation</b><br/>
 <b>@SpringBootApplication:-</b>It enable three things<br/>
 <b>(i)-</b>@EnableAutoConfiguration : enable auto-configuration mechanism<br/>
 <b>(ii)-</b>@ComponentScan : enable @Component scan<br/>
 <b>(iii)-</b>@SpringBootConfiguration : register extra beans in the context<br/>
 <b>@EnableAutoConfiguration:-</b>This annotation enables auto-configuration of the Spring Application Context, attempting to guess and configure beans that we are likely to need based on the presence of predefined classes in classpath.<br/>
 <b>@Component:-</b>Spring Component annotation is used to denote a class as Component. It means that Spring framework will autodetect these classes for dependency injection when annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning is used<br/>
 <b>@SpringBootConfiguration:-</b>As per the Spring documentation, @SpringBootConfiguration is just an alternative to the Spring standard @Configuration<br/>
 <img alt="SpringBootConfiguration" src="image/SpringBootConfiguration.jpg"><br/>
 <b>@ImportAutoConfiguration:-</b>It import and apply only the specified auto-configuration classes. The difference between @ImportAutoConfiguration and @EnableAutoConfiguration is that later attempts to configure beans that are found in the classpath during scanning,
 whereas @ImportAutoConfiguration only runs the configuration classes that we provide in the annotation.</b><br/>
 <pre>
 @ImportAutoConfiguration({WebMvcAutoConfiguration.class
    ,DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration.class
    ,EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration.class
    ,ServerPropertiesAutoConfiguration.class
    ,HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration.class})
	public class App 
	{
	// class body
	}
 </pre>
 <b>@ConditionalOnBean and @ConditionalOnMissingBean:-</b>These annotations let a bean be included based on the presence or absence of specific beans.It�s value attribute is used to specify beans by type or by name. Also the search attribute lets us
    limit the ApplicationContext hierarchy that should be considered when searching for beans.Using these annotations at the class level prevents registration of the @Configuration class as a bean if the condition does not match.<br/>
 @SpringBootTest<br/>
 @ConfigurationProperties<br/>
 @CookieValue<br/>
 @CrossOrigin<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@Configuration:-</b>@Configuration annotation indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What are the Spring Boot starters and what are available the starters<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency management providers which can be used in the application to enable dependencies. These starters, make development easy and rapid<br/>
 All the available starters come under the org.springframework.boot group<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What do you understand by auto-configuration in Spring Boot and how to disable the  auto-configuration<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Auto-configuration is used to automatically configure the required configuration for the application. For example, if you have a data source bean present in the classpath of the application, then it<br/>
 automatically configures the JDBC template. With the help of auto-configuration, you can create a Java application in an easy way, as it automatically configures the required beans, controllers, etc.<br/>
 To disable the auto-configuration property, you have to exclude attribute of @EnableAutoConfiguration, in the scenario where you do not want it to be applied.<br/>
 @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})<br/>
 If the class is not on the classpath, then to exclude the auto-configuration, you have to mention the following code:<br/>
 @EnableAutoConfiguration(excludeName={Sample.class})<br/>
 Apart from this, Spring Boot also provides the facility to exclude list of auto-configuration classes by using the spring.autoconfigure.exclude property.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">MicroServices:-</b><br/>
 A set of loosely coupled  collaborating services Each service is<br/>
 <b style="color: red">==></b>Highly maintainable and testable<br/>
 <b style="color: red">==></b>Loosely coupled with other services<br/>
 <b style="color: red">==></b>Independently deployable<br/>
 <b style="color: red">==></b>Capable of being developed by small team<br/>
 <b style="color: red">==></b>Services can be developed independent to each other<br/>
