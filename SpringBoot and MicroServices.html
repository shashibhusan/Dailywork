<b class="redC">Spring security after Spring Boot 3.0</b><br/>
<b>For Authentication:-</b><br/> 
<b>1-</b> You need to define a bean of userDetailsService manually and give it AuthenticationProvider<br/>
<b>2-</b> AuthenticationProvider communicate with userDetailsService & create userDetails object and set to Authentication object.  
<br/>
<br/>
<b>For Authorization:-</b>
Spring security provides SecurityFilterChain class for Authorization so what we can do  
we can use this class expose it as a bean and configure our Authorization stuff
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Method Level Authorization:-</b> 
If you want to use method level Authorization then you need to use 
@PreAuthorize annotation at method level and enable it by using @EnableMethodSecurity annotation 
as shown in code snippet
<br/>
<br/>
Majar difference in spring security after Spring Boot 3.0 is that we need to create all the beans manually like<br/>
UserDetails<br/>
SecurityFilterChain<br/>
AuthenticationProvider<br/>
AuthenticationManager<br/> 
<br/>
Please notice that if multiple Spring interceptors are configured, the preHandle() method is executed in the configuration order,
whereas postHandle() and afterCompletion() methods are invoked in the reverse order.
<br/>
<br/>
 <b class="redC">Graceful shutdown:-</b><br/>
Graceful shutdown is a feature in Spring Boot that allows the application to finish ongoing tasks and handle active
requests before shutting down. It ensures that the application exits gracefully without abruptly terminating requests,
reducing the risk of data loss or client disruptions.<br/>
<b class="redC">Note:-</b><br/>
Microservice communication 
Some of the common protocols that microservices use in communication are API calls, gRPC, and Message Brokers.<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is Spring WebFlux<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
Spring Framework 5.0, released in September 2017, introduced a non-blocking reactive-stack web framework called Spring WebFlux.
There were two major reasons for a new web framework. First, there was a need for a non-blocking implementation to handle concurrency with less threads (i.e. using fewer hardware resources).
And then Java 8 introduced lambda expressions as a new language feature bringing functional style programming to Java. They allow declarative composition of asynchronous logic which is precisely what Spring WebFlux is about.<br/>
<b class="redC">Note:-</b> If your application has HTTP calls to remote services, you could give a try to the reactive WebClient, which is Spring WebFluxâ€™s alternative to RestTemplate.<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is Docker used for?<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
Docker provides a container environment that is used to host applications.<br/>
 <br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>Give the major difference between Cohesion and Coupling?<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
Coupling is the relationship between two modules while cohesion is the relationship between two or more parts within a module.<br/>
<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>How will you achieve asynchronous communication between Microservices?<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
Well, like synchronous communication there are multiple ways to achieve asynchronous 
communication in Microservices architecture like you can use Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, 
and ActiveMQ. Message brokers allows senders to send and forget and receiver then can 
process when they are free giving both sender and receiver freedom to work on their speed.<br/>
 <br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is an Idempotence and where it is used?<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
Idempotence is the property of being able to do something twice in such a way that the end result will remain the same i.e. as if it had been done once only<br/>
<br/>
Usage: Idempotence is used at the remote service, or data source so that, when it receives the instruction more than once, it only processes the instruction once.<br/>
<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>Discuss strategies for monitoring and managing the performance of microservices.<br/> 
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b> What I have used for checking the performance of the End point is Jmeter.<br/>
<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>How do you handle security concerns, such as authentication and authorization, in a microservices environment?<br/> 
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b> Using OAuth/Spring security for Authentication and JWT for securing API ends point.<br/>
<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is spring cloud.<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b>Spring Cloud--an open-source library--makes it easy to develop Java based applications for the cloud<br/>
<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is Kubernates.<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b>Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.<br/>
<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>How would you test microservies based architecture<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
1- Unit testing that we do as developer.<br/>
2- integration testing which is part of CI/CD pipeline.<br/>
3- End-to-End testing which is performed by QA team.<br/>
4- UI Testing that is also performed by QA team only.<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is client side & Server side service discovery.<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
 https://www.nginx.com/blog/service-discovery-in-a-microservices-architecture/#:~:text=In%20systems%20that%20use%20client,request%20to%20an%20available%20instance.<br/>
 
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>How to stop spring boot based microservies at startup if it can not connect to config server during bootstrap<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b>spring:<br/>
      cloud:<br/>
         config:<br/>
             fail-fast: true<br/>
			 <br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What should be preferred communication style in microservies sychronous or asynchronous<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
We should must use asynchronous way of communication while handling the request, using some reliable queue mechanism.<br/>
and communication is synchronous when one service sends a request to another service and waits for the response before proceeding further.<br/>
The most common implementation of Sync communication is over HTTP using protocols like REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.<br/>
<br/>
<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What are Cloud-Native applications?<br/>
<b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
Cloud-Native Applications (NCA) is a style of application development that encourages easy adoption of best practices in the area of<br/>
continuous delivery and distributed software development. These applications are designed specifically for a cloud computing<br/>
architecture (AWS, Azure, CloudFoundary, etc).<br/>

DevOps, continuous delivery, microservices, and containers are the key concepts in developing cloud-native applications.<br/>

Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Docker, Jenkins, Git are a few tools that can help you write Cloud-Native Application without much effort.<br/>

 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is Claims in JWT Token<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
  JSON web tokens (JWTs) claims are pieces of information asserted about a subject. For example, an ID token<br/>
 (which is always a JWT) can contain a claim called name that asserts that the name of the user authenticating is "John Doe".<br/>

	<b class="redC"> Load Balancer:- </b><br/>
	1-Netflix Ribbon client side load Balancer<br/>
	2-ZUUL Gateway also works as server side Load Balancer<br/>
	3-Spring Cloud Gateway also works as server side Load Balancer<br/>
	
	Note:-If you are using Netflix Eureka and your service is registered with it then to use Netflix Ribbon load
			balancer you don't need to add the dependencies in pom file because both come from same family so if you use 
			@LoadBalanced Annotation over the bean(eg. RestTemplate bean) in your service it will by default use Netflix Ribbon load balancer.<br/>
			
	<b class="redC"> Load balancer algorithms:- </b><br/>
      1- Round Robin<br/>
      2- Least Connection<br/>
      3- Agent-Based Adaptive Load Balancing<br/>
	 
	<b class="redC">Circuit breaker pattern providers</b><br/>

	1-Spring Cloud Gateway<br/>
	2-Netflix Zuul Gateway<br/>
	
	<b class="redC">Service registry & Discovery</b><br/>
	There is two type of service discovery<br/>
	1-Client side service discovery<br/>
	Example:- Netflix Eureka<br/>
	2-Server Side service discovery<br/>
	Example:- AWS Elastic Load Balancer(EBL)<br/> 
	<b class="redC">Note :- </b><br/>
	The Service Discovery mechanism helps us know where each instance is located.<br/>
	<b class="redC">Zuul:- </b><br/>
	ZUUL is a load balancer , routing application and reverse proxy server as well.<br/>
	That is before we were using apache for reverse proxy things , now , for microservices we can use ZUUL.<br/>
	Advantage is, in ZUUL we can programatically set configurations, like if /customer/* comes go to this microservice like that.<br/>
	Also ZUUL can act as a load balancer as well , which will pick the appropriate microservice in a round robin fashion.<br/>
	SO how does the ZUUL knows the details of microservices, the answer is eureka.<br/>
	It will work along with eureka to get microservice details.<br/>
	And in fact this ZUUL is also a Eureka client where we should mark using @EnableDiscoveryClient, thats how these 2 apps(Eureka and zuul) linked.<br/>
	<br/>
	<b class="redC">Note:- </b>YAML can't be loaded using @PropertySource annotation.<br/>
	<b class="redC">Question :-</b> What is TLS <br/>

	<b>Post Request</b><br/>
	1-postForObject(url, request, classType)<br/>
	2-exchange(url, requestEntity, responseType)<br/>
	<b>Put Request</b><br/>
	1-put(url, request)<br/>
	<b>Delete Request</b><br/>
	1-delete(url)<br/>
 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is the exact difference between service discovery and Service Gateway?<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
		 The Services gateway (a.k.a. API gateway) is receiving requests from the clients. It is the (single)
		 service that the clients see. But it doesn't know by itself how to do what the clients want so it must
		 forward the request to another service. It inspects the URL and extracts the name of the service that
		 will actually serve the request, the backend service. That backend service may be located on a
		 different machine. It may have a dynamic address or port, that may change from time to time, from
		 different reasons (nodes fail, new nodes are added to the network etc).<br/>
		 <br/>
		 So, the gateway doesn't know where to forward the request. This is the job of the Service-discovery
		 service (Eureka). Eureka knows on which node is located and at which address and port every
		 service is listening for requests. The gateway is asking Eureka where it can find the backend service
		 (by sending it only its name). After Eureka is responding, the gateway is forwarding the request to that address.<br/>
 
 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is the service model of cloud services<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b>
	 <br/>
	SaaS : software as a Service like Gmail<br/>
	PaaS : Plateform as a service like AWS Elastic Beanstalk,Windows Azure,Google App Engine<br/>
	IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service<br/>

	6-terremark<br/>	
	
	<b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is cloud<br/>

	<b class="redC">Answer:-</b>If we describe in more general term we can say that there are organization that go ahead bought the server, compute capacity,storage places,compute services
				& all other things and they have their own channel or network.<br/>
				All you have to do is to go ahead rent the resources only to amount you needed & Only for time being you needed.
				and other things is that these providers/organization will take care of all the other things like maintainance & security & other things.
				so that you can focus on your business only forget about all the other things.<br/>

 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is Service Discovery<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b> Service Discovery is the action of retrieving a specific service for your need, basically asking the service registry to get an URL to call.<br/>
 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is Service Registry<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b>
 Service registry is the registry where all services register themselves, giving a way to contact them (public API, IP, port).<br/>
 <b>In other word</b><br/>
 The service registry is a key part of service discovery. It is a database containing the network locations of service instances. A service registry needs to be highly available and up to date.<br/>
 <b>Netflix Eureka is good example of a service registry</b><br/>
 <b class="redC">Other examples</b> of service registries include:etcd,consul,Apache Zookeeper<br/>

 <b class="redC">Question:-</b>What is Spring Boot CrudRepository<br/>
 <b class="redC">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Spring Boot provides an interface called CrudRepository that contains methods for CRUD operations. It is defined in the package
 org.springframework.data.repository. It extends the Spring Data Repository interface. It provides generic Crud operation on a
 repository. If we want to use CrudRepository in an application, we have to create an interface and extend the CrudRepository.

 <b style="color: red">Question:-What is Spring Boot</b><br/>
 Spring Boot is a project that is built on the top of the Spring Framework.<br/>
 It provides an easier and faster way to set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">or</b><br/>
 In short, Spring Boot is the combination of Spring Framework and Embedded Servers.<br/>
 <br/>
 <img src="image/what-is-spring-boot.png" alt="What is Spring Boot"><br/>
 
 <b style="color: red">Advantages of Spring Boot</b><br/>
 1-It tests web applications easily with the help of different Embedded HTTP servers such as Tomcat, Jetty, etc.<br/>
 We don't need to deploy WAR files.<br/>
 2-There is no requirement for XML configuration.<br/>
 3-It offers a CLI tool for developing and testing the Spring Boot application.<br/>
 4-It offers the number of plug-ins.<br/>
 5-It also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes (the code that has to be included in many places with little or no<br/>
 alteration), XML configuration, and annotations.<br/>
 6-It increases productivity and reduces development time.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">What Spring Boot brings to the table</b><br/>
 1-Convetion over configuration<br/>
 2-Stadardizatiion for MicroServices<br/>
 3-Integrated server for development<br/>

 <b style="color: red">Question:-What is starter template</b><br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Spring Boot starters are templates that contain a collection of all the relevant transitive dependencies that are needed to start a particular functionality.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@EnableAutoConfiguration:-</b>This annotation enable Spring Boot to automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@SpringBootApplication:-</b>The entry point of the spring boot application is the class contains @SpringBootApplication annotation and the main method.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Note:-</b>If you added @SpringBootApplication annotation to the class, you do not need to add the
 @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan and @SpringBootConfiguration annotation.The @SpringBootApplication annotation includes all other annotations.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@ComponentScan:-</b>Spring Boot application scans all the beans and package declarations when the application initializes.
 You need to add the @ComponentScan annotation for your class file to scan your components added in your project.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Note:-</b>There is spring intializr page using this page create spring boot application.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Creating Spring Boot application</b><br/>
 Spring Boot had been built for rapid application development<br/>
 Creating spring boot application using<br/>
 1-Eclipse Maven<br/>
 2-start.spring.io<br/>
 3-Eclipse STS<br/>
 4-Spring Boot CLI<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Run Spring Boot application using</b><br/>
 1-Java CLI<br/>
 2-Eclipse IDE <br/>
 <b style="color: red">--></b>SpringBoot works for JDK 1.6 and above version<br/>
 <b style="color: red">--></b>slf4j works as logger in the application when we use spring Boot<br/>
 <b style="color: red">commond to make jar file</b><br/> 
 1st go to the pom.xml location then Type mvn install. A jar file will be created in that location<br/>
 then type java -jar "name_of the_jar_file" then jar file will be executed which we can check on the browser<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What is Spring Boot CLI<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>The Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command line tool that you can use to quickly prototype with Spring.
 It lets you run Groovy scripts, which means that you have a familiar Java-like syntax without so much boilerplate code.
 <b>You do not need to use the CLI to work with Spring Boot, but it is definitely the quickest way to get a Spring application off the ground.</b><br/>
 <b style="color: red">Disadvantages of Spring Boot</b><br/>
 <b style="color: red">1-Migration Efforts</b><br/>
 Migration form already existing spring project to spring boot is not straightforward. Spring Boot is mostly for new development.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">2-Deployment to WebSphere/WebLogic/Other App Servers</b><br/>
 Deploying Spring Boot application to WebSphere/WebLogic and other App servers are not very simple.You need to make few changes
 like downgrading JPA Version,removing conflicting Jars etc in order to make it work in application server.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">3-MicroServices & Cloud Native</b><br/> 
 Spring Boot has been developed Keeping Micro services & Cloud Native in mind. You my not see improvements in other areas.<br/>
 Note:- you can get all the application properties by simply google to "spring boot common application properties"<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>what is spring data jpa.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>Spring Data JPA API provides JpaTemplate class to integrate spring application with JPA. JPA (Java Persistent API) is the sun specification for persisting objects in the enterprise application.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b><br/>
 What is Spring Boot Actuator<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Spring Boot provides actuator to monitor and manage our application. Actuator is a tool which has HTTP endpoints. when
 application is pushed to production, you can choose to manage and monitor your application using HTTP endpoints.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>How to connect Spring Boot to the database using JPA<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>Spring Boot provides spring-boot-starter-data-jpa starter to connect Spring application with relational database efficiently. You can use it into project POM (Project Object Model) file<br/>
 <b style="color: red">What are some important features of using Spring Boot</b><br/>
 1-Starter dependency<br/>
 2-Auto-Configuration<br/>
 3-Spring Initializer<br/>
 4-Spring Actuator<br/>
 5-Spring CLI<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What embedded containers does Spring Boot support?<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b>Spring Boot support three embedded containers: Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow. By default, it uses Tomcat as embedded containers but you can change it to Jetty or Undertow.<br/>
 
 <b style="color: red">Important Spring Annotation</b><br/>
 <b>@SpringBootApplication:-</b>It enable three things<br/>
 <b>(i)-</b>@EnableAutoConfiguration : enable auto-configuration mechanism<br/>
 <b>(ii)-</b>@ComponentScan : enable @Component scan<br/>
 <b>(iii)-</b>@SpringBootConfiguration : register extra beans in the context<br/>
 <b>@EnableAutoConfiguration:-</b>This annotation enables auto-configuration of the Spring Application Context, attempting to guess and configure beans that we are likely to need based on the presence of predefined classes in classpath.<br/>
 <b>@Component:-</b>Spring Component annotation is used to denote a class as Component. It means that Spring framework will autodetect these classes for dependency injection when annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning is used<br/>
 <b>@SpringBootConfiguration:-</b>As per the Spring documentation, @SpringBootConfiguration is just an alternative to the Spring standard @Configuration<br/>
 <img alt="SpringBootConfiguration" src="image/SpringBootConfiguration.jpg"><br/>
 <b>@ImportAutoConfiguration:-</b>It import and apply only the specified auto-configuration classes. The difference between @ImportAutoConfiguration and @EnableAutoConfiguration is that later attempts to configure beans that are found in the classpath during scanning,
 whereas @ImportAutoConfiguration only runs the configuration classes that we provide in the annotation.</b><br/>
 <pre>
 @ImportAutoConfiguration({WebMvcAutoConfiguration.class
    ,DispatcherServletAutoConfiguration.class
    ,EmbeddedServletContainerAutoConfiguration.class
    ,ServerPropertiesAutoConfiguration.class
    ,HttpMessageConvertersAutoConfiguration.class})
	public class App 
	{
	// class body
	}
 </pre>
 <b>@ConditionalOnBean and @ConditionalOnMissingBean:-</b>These annotations let a bean be included based on the presence or absence of specific beans.Itï¿½s value attribute is used to specify beans by type or by name. Also the search attribute lets us
    limit the ApplicationContext hierarchy that should be considered when searching for beans.Using these annotations at the class level prevents registration of the @Configuration class as a bean if the condition does not match.<br/>
 @SpringBootTest<br/>
 @ConfigurationProperties<br/>
 @CookieValue<br/>
 @CrossOrigin<br/>
 <b style="color: red">@Configuration:-</b>@Configuration annotation indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What are the Spring Boot starters and what are available the starters<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Spring Boot starters are a set of convenient dependency management providers which can be used in the application to enable dependencies. These starters, make development easy and rapid<br/>
 All the available starters come under the org.springframework.boot group<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Question:-</b>What do you understand by auto-configuration in Spring Boot and how to disable the  auto-configuration<br/>
 <b style="color: red">Answer:-</b><br/>
 Auto-configuration is used to automatically configure the required configuration for the application. For example, if you have a data source bean present in the classpath of the application, then it<br/>
 automatically configures the JDBC template. With the help of auto-configuration, you can create a Java application in an easy way, as it automatically configures the required beans, controllers, etc.<br/>
 To disable the auto-configuration property, you have to exclude attribute of @EnableAutoConfiguration, in the scenario where you do not want it to be applied.<br/>
 @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude={DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})<br/>
 If the class is not on the classpath, then to exclude the auto-configuration, you have to mention the following code:<br/>
 @EnableAutoConfiguration(excludeName={Sample.class})<br/>
 Apart from this, Spring Boot also provides the facility to exclude list of auto-configuration classes by using the spring.autoconfigure.exclude property.<br/>
 <b style="color: red">MicroServices:-</b><br/>
 A set of loosely coupled  collaborating services Each service is<br/>
 <b>==></b>Highly maintainable and testable<br/>
 <b>==></b>Loosely coupled with other services<br/>
 <b>==></b>Independently deployable<br/>
 <b>==></b>Capable of being developed by small team<br/>
 <b>==></b>Services can be developed independent to each other<br/>
 <b>==></b>Communication among services via HTTP/REST/AMQP<br/>
