I am working for capgemini & client was HSBC bank, UK region. 
HSBC uses product name EDQ that is a Oracle product, it does lot of things....One of them is data processing. 
there is multiple processing unit or you can say multiple jobs.

Now what happend,HSBC need very specific change in the few jobs that Oracle denies but suggest that they will provide the required library
Then you can developed your own processing unit that is a seperate spring boot project put them on Weblogic server and can do the same. 
That is what I was doing ...developing seperate standalone spring boot application & deploying them on Weblogic server.

One more things is that we are using concept of Mbeans in this web aaplication.

So,
War file is the 1st Part.
2nd is a client program : Will make the connection with instances running on weblogic server & will access the Mbeans
3rd is Conrtol-M jobs.

In that web application,we are using the concept of Mbeans
So, What we were doing was that we have created a java program & write the logic of accessing the Mbeans in Weblogic logic server 
putting the compile code of this program somewhere on the server.

Then we have Conrtol-M jobs that will execute the java program using java command ....So what that program will do.
will create connection with server & then invoke() the Operation inside Mbeans. 
 
I can give some high level explaination of that standalone web application.
There is mainly five module 
1- Parser
2- Reader Service
3- Transformer Service
4- Writer Service
5- Logical runner

Parser:-Parser will parse multiple Xmls & will get know the table information. We are using javax.xml.parser
that is DocumentBuilderFactory.

Reader Service :- Reader service responsible to read the data from database.

Transformer service :- Transformer service will responsible for decryption & Transformation of the data using Library provided by Oracle.

Writer service :- Writer service is responsible for writing the data back to database.

So, we are creating three type of threads using executor framework, that is reader, Transformer, Writer corresponding to each service
and implementing the producer & consumer concept using LinkedBlockingQueue.

Before that I was woking in Travel domain and the project was a B2B project.
Where I was working on Integeration of two system...There was multiple step but I was part of Invoice & creditNote generation.


Let suppose there is a travel service provider like ThomasCook india....and there is an other business organization let say Reliance JIO.
So, If JIO employee want to use the service of ThomasCook which is travel service provider.
Then we need to sync the employee data of JIO in ThomasCook system...and then JIO employee make any booking on ThomasCook

and in the end of the month ThomasCook will send all the invoices & creditNote to Reliance JIO for accounting

I was working on this part of sending invoices & creditNote note in client system.

and then that URL will be schedule in Crone Job on Linux server.

This project was for SAP only and client was Chevron.
I was developed in CAP (CAPM)
The Cloud Application Programming Model is an open and opinionated framework of languages, libraries and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications.
I worked for almost a year, I worked there for two modules
 
1- IOTOnboarding :- When we onboard any technical object then after successful onboarding of TO once there is Transaction Id correspong to 
	TO it in DB, Then I have to perfom certain set of action that includes getting some data from ERP system & S4 System, doing some comparision pushing 
	it to other systems and then also making a local storage as well. 
	
2-  Inspection-Srv :- It was customized Dashboard for displaying TO object information on three different levels that is TO,Zone Level & CML 
	Level(Actually there are three level of information for a TO)and infomation that we were displaying were Characteristic Information & Indicator data information
	that we were getting from Assetbase & IOTOnboarding respectively.
	For customization we were getting configuration from configuration service and based on that configuration were displaying on dash board.

AN network is a multi-module project and I was working on one of it's module called txn-doc-service
which responsible for createPO, createInvoice for PO, PO for return Item, cancel PO.

So what I was doing is that Actually AN is old one and they have developed few more application on top of it but for all the back-end activity
and for business logic these applications are depended on AN and for that reason there required some changes on AN side as well

and when i joined the project those applications were already developed but there was some backlogs.
and backlogs of type some medium & low priority bugs some perfomance issue due to unwated queries & joins 
and there was some integration test that was failing 
Note:- DBeaver tool was there for table & data access 

Note:-The SAP Internet of Things solution (SAP IoT) is a collection of services, apps, and UI templates that help you modeling digital twins of
	real-world objects that you want to monitor, track, or analyze.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, I did three project with SAP
1- IOTOnboarding & Inspection-Srv and client was Chevron
then I worked for 
2- AN network
where I was working for One of its module txn-doc-service 
3-TMS & TMS Library.
In simple word I can say it is orchestration Service that help in data migration we migrate from shared schema to
dedicated schema.
