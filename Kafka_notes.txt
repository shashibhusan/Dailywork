1-	Kafka cluster is bunch of message brokers that runs on group of computer.They take message record 
		from producer and stores in Kafka message logs
2-	Broker is a Kafka server.
3-	Cluster is a group of computers sharing workload for a common purpose.
4-	Topic is a unique name for Kafka stream or data set.
5-	When stream data is huge we can’t  store all the data on same computer
	we need to break the data in multiple part and each part will be store by a different computer.
	This is the concept of partition.
6-	Offset is a sequence id given to messages as they arrive in a partition. There is no global offset value.
		So if you want to access a message you need to know three things.
		(i)Topic Number
		(ii)Partition Number
		(iii)Offset
7-	Consumer group is a group of consumers acting as a single logical unit.
8-	Kafka doesn’t allow more the two consumer to read data from same partition simultaneously to avoid double reading of record.
9-	Replication factor:- Number of total copy for a partition to handle fault Tolerance.
	But we define it at topic level and that will apply on all the partition within the topic

Question:-What is ZooKeeper role in Kafka?
Answer:-
	If we must define the role of Zookeeper in a few words, we can say that Zookeeper acts a Kafka cluster coordinator that manages cluster membership of brokers,
	producers, and consumers participating in message transfers via Kafka. It also helps in leader election for a Kafka topic.
