Pod : 
	Pod is a smallest unit of K8s
	basically it's an abstraction over container
	each pod have it's own IP address
Service:
	have Permanent static IP address 
	and lifecycle of Pod and service Not connected
	it also a load balancer
Node:
	A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be
	either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster.
Ingress:
	 Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that provides routing rules
	 to manage access to the services within a Kubernetes cluster. 
Config Map:
	It's a external configuration of your application.
Secret:
	It is used to store secret data that is base64 encoded.
Volumes:
	It is a storage on local machine or remote, outside of the K8s
	cluster.
Deployment:
	blueprint for apps
	you create Deployments
	it's a abstraction of Pods
StatefulSet:
	for STATEFUL apps like DB
	Important point
	Deployment for stateLess Apps but StatefulSet for stateFUL
Minikube:
		It's a one node K8s culster that run on our local machine.
Kubectl: It is a command line tool for k8s cluster
		 apps or database.
		 
Now it is diffcult task to deploy stateFUL Apps So,DB ARE
OFTEN HOSTED OUTSIDE OF K8S CULSTER.

Kubelet:
	It interacts with both the container and node.
	It starts the pod with a container inside.
Kube proxy:
	Kube proxy forwards the requests.
3 important processess of node
	i)- Kubelet
	ii)- Kube Proxy
	iii)- Container runtime
Master processes
	i)APIserver, is a Cluster gate
	ii)Scheduler
	iii)Contoller Manager
	iv) etcd. is a cluster brain
