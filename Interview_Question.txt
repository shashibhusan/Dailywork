@Configuration

Annotating a class with @Configuration indicates that its primary purpose is as a source of bean definitions and also
@Configuration is meta-annotated with @Component

@ComponentScan

In case our @SpringBootApplication class can’t be at the root of our project or we want to scan outside sources,
we can configure @ComponentScan explicitly to look in whatever package we specify, as long as it exists on the classpath.

@Controller

@Controller annotation is an annotation used in Spring MVC framework.
The @Controller annotation indicates that a particular class serves the role of a controller.
The @Controller annotation acts as a stereotype for the annotated class, indicating its role.
The dispatcher scans such annotated classes for mapped methods and detects @RequestMapping annotations.

@Component

Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning.

@Service

This annotation only classify bean as service level beans and have no additional processing like @Repository. 

@Repository annotation also catch platform specific exceptions and re-throw them Spring specific unchecked exception. 
@Repository catches persistence specific checked exceptions and rethrow them as one of Spring’s unified unchecked exception.
The @Repository annotation can catch the persistence related exceptions and wrap them into Runtime Exceptions.

There is no direct way to prevent sub-class from serialization in java.
One possible way by which a programmer can achieve this is by implementing the writeObject() and readObject() methods in the subclass and needs to throw NotSerializableException from these methods.

Which is better based on the performance method overloading or method overriding.

Performance: Overloading gives better performance compared to overriding. The reason is that the binding of overridden methods is being done at runtime.

Difference between init block and static

The non-static initializer block on the other hand is created on object construction only
